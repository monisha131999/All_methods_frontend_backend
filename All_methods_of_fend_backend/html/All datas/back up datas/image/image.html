Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bengaluru, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.<br>
The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.
